        <div class="about-display">
            In the heart of the South, where traditions are baked into every bite, lies a small, unassuming bakery run by someone with a deep connection to the recipes passed down through generations. 
            This bakery isn’t a commercial enterprise or a business with a sign out front, but rather a passion project born from a need for healing.
            <br>For as long as they can remember, the kitchen has been a place of refuge, where flour dusted countertops and the scent of warm sugar could soothe even the most troubled mind. 
            The recipes are southern family treasures—time-tested, not too sweet, but sweet enough to bring people back for more. 
            <br>Every dessert holds a story of its own, crafted with precision, love, and a pinch of nostalgia.
             More than just a hobby, this little bakery represents a journey toward mental wellness. 
            <br>Each pie, cake, and batch of cookies reflects pride and passion, a reminder that sometimes the simplest things—a buttery crust, a drizzle of caramel—can be the most profound source of joy.
            <br>In a world full of sugar and excess, the desserts made here are balanced, just like life, inviting others to taste not just the sweetness, but the care and tradition baked into every creation. 
            <br>Customers return, not just for the flavor, but for the feeling of home that comes with every bite.
